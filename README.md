DATA PATH:

The fetch phase and the execution phase are the two stages of instruction processing. The CPU hardware can be conveniently divided into two matching pieces. While one segment obtains the instructions, the other carries them out. The portion that retrieves instructions is also in charge of decoding them and producing the control signals that direct the execution section to perform the necessary tasks. The section responsible for execution reads the data operands given in an instruction, executes the necessary calculations, and saves the output.

The hardware must now be arranged into a multi-stage structure that resembles with the stages matching the five processes. A potential configuration is depicted in Figure 5.7. One clock cycle is needed to finish the tasks in each of the five stages. Hardware stage 1 retrieves an instruction in step 1 and inserts it into the IR. In step 2, it is decoded and its source registers are read. The control signals for each and every step that comes after are created using the data in the IR. As a result, the instruction must be held by the IR until its execution is finished.

Registers must be inserted in between steps. In order to be used as inputs to the subsequent stage during the subsequent clock cycle, inter-stage registers store the output of one stage. This results in the configuration. The datapath is the term used to describe the hardware in the figure. It fits into stages two through five. Registers RA and RB contain the data that was read from the register file. The information for the ALU's input InA is provided by Register RA. The contents of RB or the current value in the IR are forwarded to the second input of the ALU, InB, by multiplexer MuxB. Stage 3 is made up of the ALU, and register RZ contains the output of the computation it completes.

Remember that step 4 of the processing procedure does not involve any processing actions for computational instructions like Add. In that phase, register RZ is chosen by multiplexer MuxYin in order to send the computation's outcome to RY. In step 5, the contents of RY are loaded into the target register and moved to the register file. The register file is in phases 2 and 5 as a result. Because it has the source registers, it belongs to stage 2, and because it has the destination register, it belongs to stage 5. The ALU calculates the memory operand's effective address in step 3 and loads it into register RZ for load and store instructions. It is transmitted to the memory from there.

that is the fourth stage. When a load instruction is used, multiplexer MuxY selects the data read from memory and stores it in register RY, where it will be moved to the register file during the subsequent clock cycle. Data are read from the register file, which is a stage 2 component, and entered into register RB for a store instruction. Since stage 4 handles memory access, the multi-stage structure requires an additional inter-stage register to ensure proper data flow. For this reason, Register RM is presented. Step 3 involves moving the data to be stored from RB to RM, and Step 4 involves moving them from RM to the RAM. In this instance, step 5 remains unfilled.

To make things easier to refer to, the return address is saved in a general-purpose register called LINK by the subroutine call instructions that were introduced. In a similar vein, saving a return address is necessary for interrupt processing.Suppose that This task is served by another general-purpose register, called IRA. The program counter's contents must be transmitted to the register file in order to complete either of these two operations. Because of this, multiplexer MuxY features a third input that allows the return address to be transferred to register RY and then to the register file. The instruction address generator generates the return address.
